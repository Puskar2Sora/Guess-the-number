## 🧩 What Is This?

This is not just a game.  
It’s a **battle between you and randomness** —

**Guess the Number** is built using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** —  
no frameworks, no crutches, just raw logic and creative design.

- 🪄 Every guess you make is tested in real-time  
- 💬 The interface responds instantly with visual and textual feedback  
- 🔁 You can reset and challenge fate again
